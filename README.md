# EctoNetwork
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adam12/ecto_network.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adam12/ecto_network)

Ecto types to support MACADDR and Network extensions provided by Postgrex.

Although this is primarily an Ecto library, it has a hard dependency on Postgrex
due to the types it is providing.

## Installation

1. Add `ecto_network` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:ecto_network, "~> 1.3.0"}] # or 0.7.0 if you're stuck on Ecto < 3
    end
    ```

2. Create your migrations using the Postgres types as atoms.

    ```elixir
    def change do
      create table(:your_table) do
        add :ip_address, :inet
        add :mac_address, :macaddr
        add :network, :cidr
      end
    end
    ```

3. Use the new types in your Ecto schemas.

    ```elixir
    schema "your_table" do
      field :ip_address, EctoNetwork.INET
      field :mac_address, EctoNetwork.MACADDR
      field :network, EctoNetwork.CIDR
    end
    ```
